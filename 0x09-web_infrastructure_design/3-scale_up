# Scale Up Infrastructure

## Overview
This document describes a scaled-up web infrastructure that hosts www.foobar.com with dedicated servers for each component type, clustered load balancers, and enhanced separation of concerns for maximum performance and reliability.

## Infrastructure Components

### User Access Flow
1. User types www.foobar.com in their browser
2. DNS resolves to Virtual IP (VIP) of load balancer cluster
3. Active load balancer receives request and distributes to web servers
4. Web server serves static content or forwards dynamic requests to application server
5. Application server processes business logic and queries database server
6. Response travels back through the same path to the user
7. If primary load balancer fails, backup automatically takes over

## Additional Elements and Justifications

### 1 Additional Server
**Why Added**:
- **Component Separation**: Enables dedicated servers for web, application, and database tiers
- **Resource Optimization**: Each server can be optimized for its specific workload
- **Independent Scaling**: Each tier can be scaled independently based on demand
- **Fault Isolation**: Issues in one component don't directly affect others
- **Security Enhancement**: Reduces attack surface through network segmentation

### Clustered Load Balancers (HAProxy)
**Why Added**:
- **Eliminates SPOF**: Removes single point of failure from load balancing layer
- **High Availability**: Automatic failover ensures continuous service availability
- **Zero Downtime**: Maintenance on one load balancer doesn't affect service
- **Increased Capacity**: Can handle more concurrent connections
- **Geographic Distribution**: Can be placed in different locations for redundancy

**Cluster Configuration**:
- **Active-Passive Setup**: One load balancer active, one standby
- **Virtual IP (VIP)**: Shared IP address that floats between load balancers
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks between cluster members
- **Automatic Failover**: Standby takes over within seconds of primary failure
- **Heartbeat Protocol**: VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol) for coordination

## Component Separation Benefits

### Dedicated Web Servers
**Purpose**: Serve static content and handle HTTP requests
**Optimizations**:
- **High-performance HTTP processing**: Optimized for concurrent connections
- **Static content caching**: Efficient serving of images, CSS, JavaScript
- **SSL termination**: Dedicated resources for encryption/decryption
- **Request routing**: Intelligent forwarding of dynamic requests

**Hardware Specifications**:
- High CPU for SSL processing
- Moderate RAM for connection handling
- Fast network interfaces
- SSD storage for static content caching

### Dedicated Application Servers
**Purpose**: Process business logic and dynamic content generation
**Optimizations**:
- **Application runtime optimization**: Tuned for specific programming language
- **Memory allocation**: Optimized for application memory requirements
- **Processing power**: Dedicated CPU for computational tasks
- **Session management**: Efficient handling of user sessions

**Hardware Specifications**:
- High CPU for processing intensive tasks
- Large RAM for application memory requirements
- Moderate storage for application files and logs
- Optimized for specific runtime environment

### Dedicated Database Servers
**Purpose**: Data storage, retrieval, and management
**Optimizations**:
- **Storage optimization**: Fast disks for database operations
- **Memory allocation**: Large buffer pools and caches
- **Query optimization**: Dedicated resources for database operations
- **Backup and replication**: Isolated backup processes

**Hardware Specifications**:
- High-performance storage (NVMe SSD)
- Large RAM for database caching
- Moderate CPU for query processing
- Redundant storage for data protection

## Load Balancer Clustering Details

### VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol) Implementation
**How It Works**:
1. **Virtual IP Assignment**: Both load balancers share a Virtual IP (VIP)
2. **Master Election**: One load balancer becomes master, holds the VIP
3. **Heartbeat Messages**: Master sends periodic heartbeat messages
4. **Health Monitoring**: Backup monitors master's health status
5. **Automatic Failover**: Backup takes VIP if master fails
6. **Service Continuity**: Users experience no interruption

### Failover Process
```
Normal Operation:
LB1 (Master) - Holds VIP, processes traffic
LB2 (Backup) - Monitors LB1, ready to take over

Failure Scenario:
1. LB1 fails or becomes unreachable
2. LB2 detects failure (missed heartbeats)
3. LB2 promotes itself to Master
4. LB2 assumes VIP and starts processing traffic
5. Total failover time: 1-3 seconds

Recovery Scenario:
1. LB1 comes back online
2. LB1 can become Backup or reclaim Master role
3. Graceful transition without service disruption
```
