# Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

## Overview
This document describes a three-server web infrastructure that hosts www.foobar.com with enhanced security, encrypted traffic (HTTPS), and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

## Infrastructure Components

### User Access Flow
1. User types www.foobar.com in their browser
2. DNS resolves to Load Balancer IP address
3. Browser establishes HTTPS connection with SSL certificate
4. Load Balancer distributes traffic across web servers
5. Web servers process requests and interact with database
6. Monitoring clients collect data from all components

## Additional Elements and Justifications

### 3 Firewalls
**Why Added**: 
- **Firewall 1** (Load Balancer level): Filters incoming traffic before it reaches internal infrastructure
- **Firewall 2 & 3** (Server level): Provide additional security layers for individual servers
- Creates defense in depth security architecture
- Protects against various attack vectors (DDoS, port scanning, unauthorized access)

**What Firewalls Do**:
- Filter network traffic based on predefined rules
- Block malicious IP addresses and suspicious traffic patterns
- Control which ports and protocols are accessible
- Monitor and log network activity for security analysis
- Prevent unauthorized access to internal network resources

### SSL Certificate for HTTPS
**Why Added**:
- Encrypts data transmission between user and server
- Provides authentication that users are connecting to the legitimate website
- Required for modern web security standards
- Improves SEO rankings and user trust
- Protects sensitive data (passwords, personal information, payment details)

**Why Traffic is Served Over HTTPS**:
- **Data Encryption**: Prevents eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures data isn't modified during transmission
- **Authentication**: Verifies the website's identity to users
- **Compliance**: Required by many regulations (PCI DSS, GDPR)
- **User Trust**: Modern browsers mark HTTP sites as "not secure"

### 3 Monitoring Clients
**Why Added**:
- Provides comprehensive visibility into system performance
- Enables proactive issue detection and resolution
- Collects metrics from all infrastructure components
- Supports capacity planning and optimization
- Ensures high availability and performance

**What Monitoring is Used For**:
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track response times, throughput, and resource usage
- **Error Tracking**: Identify and alert on application errors and failures
- **Security Monitoring**: Detect suspicious activities and potential breaches
- **Capacity Planning**: Analyze trends to predict scaling needs
- **Compliance**: Generate reports for regulatory requirements

## Monitoring Data Collection

### How Monitoring Tool Collects Data
1. **Agent-based Collection**: Monitoring clients (agents) installed on each server
2. **Metrics Gathering**: Agents collect system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
3. **Log Aggregation**: Application and system logs are parsed and forwarded
4. **API Integration**: Direct integration with applications for custom metrics
5. **Network Monitoring**: Traffic analysis and network performance metrics
6. **Database Monitoring**: Query performance, connection counts, and database health

### Data Types Collected
- System metrics (CPU, RAM, disk usage, network I/O)
- Application performance metrics (response times, error rates)
- Security events and access logs
- Database performance and query statistics
- Custom business metrics and KPIs

## Monitoring Web Server QPS (Queries Per Second)

### Steps to Monitor QPS
1. **Configure Nginx/Apache Logs**: Enable access log with timestamp and response data
2. **Install Log Analysis Tools**: Use tools like GoAccess, AWStats, or custom scripts
3. **Set Up Monitoring Dashboard**: Configure Sumologic or similar service to parse logs
4. **Create QPS Metrics**: Extract request count per second from access logs
5. **Set Up Alerts**: Configure thresholds for high/low QPS values
6. **Historical Analysis**: Track QPS trends over time for capacity planning

### Implementation Example
```bash
# Nginx configuration for detailed logging
log_format detailed '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] '
                   '"$request" $status $body_bytes_sent '
                   '"$http_referer" "$http_user_agent" $request_time';

# Monitoring client configuration to parse and send QPS data
tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log | awk '{print $4, $7}' | monitoring_agent
```

## Infrastructure Issues

### SSL Termination at Load Balancer Level
**Problems**:
- **Unencrypted Internal Traffic**: Traffic between load balancer and web servers is not encrypted
- **Security Risk**: Internal network vulnerabilities expose sensitive data
- **Compliance Issues**: Some regulations require end-to-end encryption
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Possible attacks within internal network
- **Certificate Management**: Centralized certificate creates single point of failure

**Solutions**:
- Implement end-to-end encryption (SSL/TLS between all components)
- Use certificate management systems for distributed certificates
- Implement network segmentation and internal firewalls

### Single MySQL Write Server
**Problems**:
- **Single Point of Failure**: If master database fails, no writes are possible
- **Performance Bottleneck**: All write operations go through one server
- **Limited Scalability**: Cannot scale write operations horizontally
- **Data Loss Risk**: Potential for data loss if master fails before replication
- **Maintenance Downtime**: Updates require taking the write server offline

**Solutions**:
- Implement MySQL clustering or Galera cluster for multi-master setup
- Use database sharding for horizontal scaling
- Implement proper backup and recovery procedures
- Consider MySQL Group Replication for automatic failover

### Identical Server Components Issue
**Problems**:
- **Resource Competition**: Database, web server, and application server compete for same resources
- **Security Risk**: Compromise of one component affects all others on same server
- **Scalability Limitations**: Cannot scale individual components independently
- **Maintenance Complexity**: Updates require coordinating multiple services
- **Performance Issues**: Heavy database operations can impact web server performance
- **Single Point of Failure**: Server failure affects multiple services simultaneously

**Solutions**:
- Implement service separation (dedicated database servers, web servers, app servers)
- Use containerization (Docker) for service isolation
- Implement microservices architecture
- Use dedicated database cluster separate from web/app servers

## Additional Security and Monitoring Considerations

### Enhanced Security Measures
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) for application-layer protection
- Regular security updates and patch management
- Access control and authentication systems

### Advanced Monitoring Features
- Real-time alerting and notification systems
- Automated incident response and remediation
- Performance baseline establishment and anomaly detection
- Distributed tracing for complex request flows
- Business intelligence and analytics integration

## Conclusion
This secured and monitored infrastructure provides significant improvements over a simple web stack through defense-in-depth security, encrypted communications, and comprehensive monitoring. However, the identified issues highlight the need for careful architecture planning to avoid single points of failure and ensure optimal performance and security.
