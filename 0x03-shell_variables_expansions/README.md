# 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions

This directory contains scripts for learning shell variables, expansions, and initialization files.

## Files

* **0-alias**: Creates an alias named `ls` with the value `rm *`. When sourced, this script makes the `ls` command delete all files in the current directory instead of listing them.
